The task for small project is to investigate if some kind of additional information can be added on top of the displayed bitcoin price, to insure a visual aid in the bitcoin transactions. 
The motivation behind this BIP is in line with BIP 176 by Jimmy Song. The bitcoin price has grown over the years and once the price is past $10,000 USD or so, bitcoin amounts under $10 USD start having enough decimal places that it's difficult to tell whether the user is off by a factor of 10 or not. This proposal is a supplement to the BIP 176, utilizing the digital nature of bitcoin, to allow a visual aid in the bitcoin transactions.
The first attempt was to add colors to the different units of bitcoins.
