remark 1 :
I was skimming your draft and haven't fully read it so sorry if you have other motived for using the colour scheme the way you did but I would like to suggest that you use warmer colours for higher value amounts, and colder colours for lower value amounts. Seeing red is more eye-catching than seeing blue or green.

remark 2:
You don't want close hues for close orders of magnitude.

Many people are colorblind:

Redisplay the value (at the cost of screen real estate) using the name
minimizing leading zeros.
I also like to add additional markers to help count zeros, thought
they are nonstandard in my locale.

BTC 4,321.000,543,21
(is BTC 4,321 and 543.21 bits)


and aditional to what 'Redisplay the value (at the cost of screen real estate) using the name
minimizing leading zeros.' means:

I meant display the value another time, using more words and less
zeroes, like the example I provided.  You can see that displaying it
twice costs "real estate" (area on the screen):

> BTC 4,321.000,543,21
> (is BTC 4,321 and 543.21 bits)

If it was a much smaller amount, then the redisplay is simpler:

  BTC 0.000,543,21
  (is 543.21 bits)


remark 3:
This is not a good solution. In UX colors have expected meaning. Red often means error, yellow cation, green possible, etc... 

Text doesnâ€™t have good legibility in colors, monochrome high contrast being the best.

You will also have issues with colorblind people.
